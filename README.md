# CTkStuff
Cutomtkinter widgets that I made

<b>CTkInputPopup</b>
<p>Is basically CTkInput dialog but I like it more in the way that I made it.</p>

<b>CTkArrowOpeningMenu </b>
<p>Is a menu that opens when clicking on the little arrow icon, to put elements in it you
can't just use CTkArrowOpeningMenu as master but CTkArrowOpeningMenu.widgetsFrame.</p>

<b>CTkFloatingMenu</b>
<p>Little floating menu that stays always on top, add a button with the "add_option" function.</p>
