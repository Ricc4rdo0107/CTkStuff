Cutomtkinter widgets that I made

<b>CTkInputPopup</b>
Is basically CTkInput dialog but I like it more in the way that I made it.

<b>CTkArrowOpeningMenu </b>
Is a menu that opens when clicking on the little arrow icon, to put elements in it you
can't just use CTkArrowOpeningMenu as master but CTkArrowOpeningMenu.widgetsFrame.

<b>CTkFloatingMenu</b>
Little floating menu that stays always on top, add a button with the "add_option" function.
