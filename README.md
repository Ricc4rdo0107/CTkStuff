# CTkStuff
Cutomtkinter widgets that I made

# CTkInputPopup 
Is basically CTkInput dialog but I like it more in the way that I made it.

# CTkArrowOpeningMenu 
Is a menu that opens when clicking on the little arrow icon, to put elements in it you
can't just use CTkArrowOpeningMenu as master but CTkArrowOpeningMenu.widgetsFrame.

# CTkFloatingMenu
Little floating menu that stays always on top, add a button with the "add_option" function.
